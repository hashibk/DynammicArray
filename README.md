# Counting Sort Algorithm

This C++ program implements the Counting Sort algorithm to sort a list of integers. It first counts the occurrences of each integer and then sorts the integers based on these counts.

## Features

- **Dynamic Array Allocation**: Allocates arrays dynamically based on user input.
- **Counting Occurrences**: Counts how many times each integer appears in the input.
- **Sorting**: Sorts integers using the counting sort algorithm.
- **Display Results**: Outputs the sorted integers.

## Usage

1. **Enter Value for x**: Input the number of integers you want to sort.
2. **Input Integers**: Provide the integers one by one.
3. **Sort and Display**: The program sorts the integers using counting sort and displays the sorted result.

### Example

In the given code:

- User inputs the number of integers, for example, `5`.
- User then inputs the integers, for example, `3 1 2 1 0`.
- The program counts the occurrences of each integer and sorts them.

**Output**:
```bash
1 2 3 4 5
